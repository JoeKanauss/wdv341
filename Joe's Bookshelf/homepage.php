<h1 class="intro">Welcome to Joe's Bookshelf!</h1>
<p>Joe's Bookshelf is one book-lover's attempt at cataloguing his library of reading material, while providing a fun space for others to share what they like as well! Here you can take a gander at what I have on my reading shelves, along with what I'm wanting to read, and what I'm currently reading. You can also make a small profile where you can share your favorite books!</p>
<p>So come on in, pick up a book, and have a good time at Joe's Bookshelf!</p>
